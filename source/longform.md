bad regex (a+)+

Do ToC @ LangSec pt

standards compliant XML is (probably) Recursively enumerable
another reason XML is like violence: If you use a standards compliant parser, it can eat your lunch

*most parsers add bounds which reduces XML power to context sensitive


talk about how MuskOx makes it easier to have more definite error messages.


TL;DR

* avoid impossible problems, like validating turing complete inputs
* validate inputs before parsing
* JSON > XML; it's just ducky


* introduce lang sec
* input validation as formal lang recognition
  * but not in a painful way

in order to do that I need to explain what formal lang is
explain chomsky hierarchy


eg

sanitizing text for HTML
regex can't do it because nesting and escapes
that's why rails' sanitizer is a parser

Rails doesn't do it, and neither should you!
